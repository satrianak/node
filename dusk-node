created an easy to use ITN installer. This installer will set up Rusk as a service on your droplet, preconfigure parts of the node, and provide a couple of helper scripts.

Install Rusk by pasting the following command in your droplet terminal:

Terminal window
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/itn-installer/releases/download/v0.1.4/itn-installer.sh | sudo sh

Configure Rusk
Once everything has been set up, you will be asked to add your consensus keys. These keys are used to sign and vote for blocks.

If you haven’t made a wallet yet, go to our Web Wallet and create a new wallet. You can request funds from our faucet here. The faucet will give you 1100 tDUSK. The minimum to stake is 1000 tDUSK.

Once you have access to a Dusk mnemonic, run the following command:

Terminal window
rusk-wallet restore

If your node is not running, it will tell you some operations won't be available. This is fine, and happens due to your node not being online yet. You can still continue to follow the steps below.

You will be asked to provide your recovery phrase/mnemonic, in lowercase, and to enter a password for the wallet.

Once you’ve done so, run the following command to export a consensus key for the given wallet:

Terminal window
rusk-wallet export -d /opt/dusk/conf -n consensus.keys

You will be asked to set an encryption password for the consensus key. Remember it and run the following script to set it as an environment variable:

Terminal window
sh /opt/dusk/bin/setup_consensus_pwd.sh

If you’ve configured everything correctly, you can now start rusk:

Terminal window
service rusk start

Your node will now start syncing. You can check if it indeed is by running:

Terminal window
grep "block accepted" /var/log/rusk.log

It is best to wait until your node is synced up. You can find the latest block height on our explorer.

Stake tDUSK
The final step is to stake. You can stake by running:

Terminal window
rusk-wallet stake --amt 1000 # Or however much you want to stake

Once the transaction has gone through, you can view your staking information by running:

Terminal window
rusk-wallet stake-info

To see if your node is participating in consensus and creating blocks, occasionally check:

Terminal window
grep "execute_state_transition" /var/log/rusk.log | tail -n 5

Note that this can take a while, given that your stake needs at least 2 epochs, or 4320 blocks, to mature. Your stake, relative to the total stake, also plays a factor.

If everything went right, and your node starts accepting and creating blocks, you have succesfully set up your ITN node!
